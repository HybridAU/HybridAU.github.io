  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <h2>TLDR</h2>
<p>I bought a Nokia 6.1, I've used it for 3 months, I think it's brilliant. My wife's old phone needed replacing, I was so happy with my phone that I suggested she get a Nokia 6.1 too.</p>
<h2>Some context</h2>
<p>In May 2018 I bought a Nokia 6.1 because my Nexus 6P died. I managed to get the 64GB storage / 4GB RAM / Dual Sim version for just $300 AUD. So it's a mid-range priced phone, it's less than a third of the price of the latest iPhone or Google Pixel which each retail for over $1,000 AUD in Australia.</p>
<p>The thing is despite being a technology enthusiast who runs Arch Linux to get the latest and greatest I'm actually quite minimalist. Both on my phone and my laptop I only install the packages I need and despise bloat.</p>
<p>As such I wanted to get a phone that ran <a href="https://www.android.com/one/">Android One</a> so I would get as close to the stock Android experience as possible without all the vendor bloat. I remember when I got my Samsung Galaxy S4, it came from Telstra (Australia's largest telco) and came pre-installed with about 30 junk apps like the "AFL Footie scores" or the "Samsung Store" and "Crayon Physics" which could not be removed until I wiped the whole phone and put on CyanogenMod.</p>
<p>Similarly, as a security professional, I wanted a phone that was guaranteed to receive regular security updates for at least two years<sup id="fnref:guaranteed"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:guaranteed">1</a></sup>. Again that meant a phone that was in the <a href="https://www.android.com/one/">Android One</a> program.</p>
<p>Lastly with new phones that come out each year, for the last 5 years or more there has really been nothing other than a <a href="./fingerprint-readers-on-phones.html">Fingerprint reader</a> that I've thought was a huge improvement.</p>
<p>Every year it's the same black glass brick with no buttons. Maybe this year's model has rounded corners and last year's had square, or maybe this year's phone's CPU is 5~10% faster or has a little more ram, or has slightly more pixels, slightly better battery life or whatever. But it's always just a small improvement over last year's phone. In fact, storage on most phones went down for a while, I had a Nokia N81 in 2007 with 8GB of storage. Later I got a Nokia N97 which had 32GB storage with an SD card slot which is better than many phones sold today.</p>
<p>I don't play fancy games that need great 3D graphics or lots of CPU/RAM.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is that I'm very happy with a low-end phone.</p>
<h2>The actual review</h2>
<p>In for what I need the Nokia 6.1 is if anything overkill. It's very snappy, all the apps open quickly, I've never noticed any lag, the one game I do play on my phone <a href="http://supercell.com/en/games/clashofclans/">Clash of Clans</a> run smoothly without a hitch.</p>
<p>The camera could be a little better in low light conditions but it's still pretty good. Below are a few pictures taken on the Nokia 6.1, I have not added any filters or post-processing to correct the colours. Click on them to see the full picture with no metadata removed.<sup id="fnref:metadata"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:metadata">2</a></sup></p>

<p><em>In fairness, I've picked some of the best pictures, there were a lot of bad ones too, but it shows what can be done</em></p>
<p>Physically it feels very solid. Some of the low-end phones can feel very plasticy (and there was some story about bending iPhones) but the Nokia 6.1 feels great. I've dropped my phone on cement and stone a few times (without a case) and it hasn't even scratched yet.</p>
<p>The battery life is good, constant heavy uses playing games and watch movies on a plane with the screen on full brightness it lasts about 12~13 hours, if left in my pocket and just used to take the occasional photo or send WhatsApp messages I can easily go 48 hours or more on a single charge.</p>
<p>The fingerprint reader is good but not quite as good as the one on my old Nexus 6P, occasionally I've needed to try a few times to unlock the phone especially with sweaty hands.</p>
<p>From a software and security point of view, it's outstanding. As I've mentioned above it is part of the <a href="https://www.android.com/one/">Android One</a> program. Which means it gets security patches over the air every month and stays on the latest patch level. So far I've got the patches within a week or so of them being released.</p>
<p>I only have two complaints one is that the battery is not replaceable so when it inevitably wears out I will need to get a whole new phone.</p>
<p>The other is that I can't easily unlock the bootloader and reflash my phone which for 99% of people is not a problem anyway.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>After I'd had my phone for about 2 and a half months my Wife's phone (Sony Xperia Z5) started showing dead pixels and we decided it needed replacing. I was so happy with my Nokia 6.1 and my wife had used it a fair bit and liked it too so we decided to get a second one for her.</p>

<p>Actually I think that there should be a law that phone manufacturers must support the devices they sell until a given date, see my rant on <a href="./expiry-dates-on-smart-phones-and-other-iot-devices.html">Expiry dates on smart phones and other IoT devices</a>.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:guaranteed" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>I know this includes things like the GPS coordinates where the photo was taken, I'm fine with that.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:metadata" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
