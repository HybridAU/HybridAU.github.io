    <p>I am a huge believer in the value of instant feedback within security. It's important to pick at what point you give feedback because you don't want to risk spamming users. It's been <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/06/the_habituation.html">shown</a> several times that if you show users warnings and they are regularly false alarms that people will tune out and ignore warnings.</p>
<p>But given at the right time, and not too often, giving instant feedback to users on what they are doing can provide great security controls.</p>
<p>Two examples of this are; user logins and important transactions.</p>
<p>If you have ever used Duo Push or Google's "Google Sign-In for Android" whenever you try to log in you will get a message on your phone saying, "Is it you trying to sign in?" this more than just 2 Factor authentication. You can get 2 Factor from any TOTP app like Google Authenticator, but this also lets you know if someone has tried to log into your account.</p>
<p>At work, all Administrators had two separate Active Directory logins, one administrative account, and a regular account. Most of the work could be done with just the regular account but if you ever logged in to a server with a domain admin account you would receive an email instantly. It didn't provide 2 Factor, but it gave feedback so if an account was compromised we would know about it.</p>
<p>Another great example was I have a Citibank credit card, and with the Citibank app, I can get push notifications every time there is a transaction. I think it's a great feature, sure someone could still use my card fraudulently once but I'd get a notification and contact the bank straight away rather than waiting until I check my statement.</p>
<p>Like I said at the top of the post, it's important not to spam people, but done right push notifications are a great security tool.</p>
