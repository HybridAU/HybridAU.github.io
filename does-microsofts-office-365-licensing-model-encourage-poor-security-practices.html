    <p>I've recently survived a migration to Office 365 with relatively few scars and coming out only slightly more cynical, bitter and twisted than I was when I when I started<sup id="fnref:cynical-bitter-and-twisted"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:cynical-bitter-and-twisted">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I remember speaking to a Microsoft sales rep at some conference or other, they said that in Office 365 you only need to buy one license per users. That's it, and a user was unofficially defined as a living breathing bag of meat that has an Office 365 account.</p>
<ul>
<li>No more worrying about buying CALs for printers and photocopiers</li>
<li>No need to buy an extra license for users who had a regular account and an administrative account</li>
<li>No extra CALs because someone wants their emails on their phone <em>and</em> their laptop at the same time</li>
<li>No need to license accounts used by system scripts and scheduled tasks.</li>
<li>No worries about Per-Core vs Per-CPU licensing</li>
<li>No need to license unused CPU cores because a VM could potentially be migrated in a failover situation.</li>
<li>No weird definition of "User"<sup id="fnref:who-is-a-user"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:who-is-a-user">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Just one license per person. Simple. I was quite surprised.</p>
<p>It turns out that's not quite correct, while you don't <em>have to</em> license <abbr title="Multifunction Devices (i.e. Photocopiers)">MFDs</abbr>. In practice, if you want your photocopiers and scanners to be able to authenticate and send email using Office 365 they are going to need an account.</p>
<p>There is a work around for this, I could setup a shared account scanner@example.com, shared accounts don't need a license. I could give my account Michael.VanDelft@example.com 'Send As' permission. Then I can then setup the photocopiers to authenticate with my credentials and send email as scanner@example.com. While that's totally ok from an Office 365 licensing perspective I'm left with my username and password stored in a bunch of poorly secured photocopiers and I can't change my password without breaking the scan to email function on all our photocopiers.</p>
<p>There are some other <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/How-to-set-up-a-multifunction-device-or-application-to-send-email-using-Office-365-69f58e99-c550-4274-ad18-c805d654b4c4">work arrounds</a> for this, but they either involve direct send or running an SMTP relay and neither option is great.</p>
<p>We have a plethora of things which send email, not just photocopiers but system monitoring tools, our backup software sends reports, several system scripts, our financial system, even our firewall emails alerts occasionally.</p>
<p>If we want these all these things to send emails through Office 365 so we get DMARC, TLS, Authentication and all that other goodness that comes with a well-configured mail server we need to license them.</p>

<p>Although it's possible that I've almost reached peak cynical saturation and simply couldn't have got any more bitter and twisted even if it had been a migration to Oracle's god-awful "Oracle Communications Messaging Server".&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:cynical-bitter-and-twisted" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>We were once looking at Microsoft SQL server and we were told that if we had some software (e.g. accounting software) that used a single account to connect to the database, anyone who used that software was a "user" of the database, even if we only had one account setup in SQL server. Fair enough, I guess. But then they extrapolated that to say that if we used a CMS like WordPress with Microsoft SQL server as the back end, then we would need a license for everyone who viewed or commented on our website as they too would be a "user" of our database. Needless to say, we went with Per-Core licensing rather than per user. I've since been told that this is not correct by a number of "Microsoft Licensing Experts" however it's what we were told at the time by our reseller who was a "Microsoft Gold Certified Partner".&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:who-is-a-user" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
