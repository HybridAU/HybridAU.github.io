  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>This is a little off my usual topic of IT Security but it's something I've been thinking about a bit lately. I recently came across the "One hundred prisoners and a light bulb" riddle. It was <a href="http://www.ias.uwa.edu.au/lectures/van-ditmarsch">posed as</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A group of 100 prisoners, all together in the prison dining area, are told that they will be all put in isolation cells and then will be interrogated one by one in a room containing a light with an on/off switch. The prisoners may communicate with one another by toggling the light-switch (and that is the only way in which they can communicate). The light is initially switched off. There is no fixed order of interrogation, or interval between interrogations, and the same prisoner will be interrogated again at any stage. When interrogated, a prisoner can either do nothing, or toggle the light-switch, or announce that all prisoners have been interrogated. If that announcement is true, the prisoners will (all) be set free, but if it is false, they will all be executed. While still in the dining room, and before the prisoners go to their isolation cells (forever), can the prisoners agree on a protocol that will set them free?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there are several version that all run along the same lines but with slightly tweaked wording.</p>
<p>The general solution to the puzzle is that;</p>
<ul>
<li>All the prisoners decied to elect one prisoner as the leader.</li>
<li>When a prisoner is interrogated if the light is off and they have not switched it on before they will switch the light on. Otherwise they will leave the light unchanged.</li>
<li>Only the leader can switch the light off. After the leaer has switched the light off 99 times they know all other prisoners must have been interrogated.</li>
</ul>
<p>This works and from a logic point of view is fairly elegant. However it seemed inefficient to me. I wanted to know how many interrogations before the prisoners are set free.  I feel sure there is some mathematical way you could calculate the average but that's beyond me so I <strike>kidnaped 100 people and locked them in my basement</strike> wrote a Python script to simulate the problem.</p>

<p>Making that script object oriented is compleate overkill but it was fun to write. I've made some assumptions here, mainly that the prisoners are interrogated in a random order and continuously until one of them says "All prisoners have been interrogated".</p>
<p>It usually takes around 10400 interigations before the prisoners are set free. I then started thinking about other issues like what if the interigations are not random. My sister sent me a link to a <a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jve/papers/10/pdfs/JANCLlightbulb.pdf">journal article</a> that looks into all these posibilities. It's a fun little distraction for those who like logic puzzles.</p>
