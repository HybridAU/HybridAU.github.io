  <div class="article_text">
    <p>I was recently setting up a server on Microsoft's Azure platform from work and by default Azure pick I high port number<sup id="fnref:high-port-number"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:high-port-number">1</a></sup> and NAT it to port 3389 for RDP. I must have spent a good hour trying to work out why I couldn't connect to the server when I finally realized that I hadn't unblocked the port I was trying to connect on in our outbound firewall.</p>
<p>Now I'm <a href="./changing-ssh-from-port-22.html">skeptical</a> of the value of changing port numbers to hide services anyway but also don't know how much value, if any our outbound firewall add either.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we allow ports 22 and 443 outbound so it's easy for someone to tunnel over ssh or proxy through a HTTPS website. Basically, if someone wants to connect out of our network, the firewall not going to stop them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we don't open port 23 so if someone brought in a home route infected with Mirai and it tried to telnet out to infect others, or some other dumb worm that uses a port we don't have open then our firewall would at least block that.</p>
<p>So like many defenses in depth things, by itself, it's not going to make much difference, but it's one more layer that malware needs to get around.</p>
