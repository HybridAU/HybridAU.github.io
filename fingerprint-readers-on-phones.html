  <div class="article_text">
    <p>I can clearly remember my first reaction when I heard about fingerprint readers on phones. It was a stream of thoughts along the lines of "I bet that will be broken in an matter of days, biometrics are not ready for prime time", "You don't go around leaving a smudgy copy of your password on every glass you hold" and "You can change your password but good luck resetting your fingerprint after that gets compromised."</p>
<p>But I was falling into a trap that's all to common in information security<sup id="fnref:security"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:security">1</a></sup> of rejecting an idea because it isn't perfect. When the question that I <a href="https://xo.tc/perfectly-good.html">should have been asking</a> isn't "Is it flawless?" but "Is it better than what we currently have?".</p>
<p>Shortly after my initial reaction I started thinking a little more deeply about the idea and I could think of a number of friends and family that didn't even use a pin on their phone because it was too much effort to unlock every time. I decided that if a fingerprint reader was significantly more <a href="https://xo.tc/avids-rule-of-usability.html">convenient</a> and if that was enough to get people to lock their phone then it would be a net win for security.</p>
<p>I recently bought a <a href="https://store.google.com/product/nexus_6p">Nexus 6P</a> and installed <a href="https://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Angler_Info">CyanogenMod</a>. Now that I've got a fingerprint reader I think it's just brilliant. Previously I used a pattern to lock my screen and for my encryption key because it was quick and easy. Now I use a 16 character password<sup id="fnref:16-character-password"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:16-character-password">2</a></sup> which is hard to type for the lock screen and encryption key. Then when I want to unlock it for every day use I just use my fingerprint.</p>
<p>I still need to enter my password to decrypt my phone if I reboot it. And every three days it <a href="https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/25b4d4b280c6aa07656328bd9dd90977781d00e1/packages/Keyguard/src/com/android/keyguard/KeyguardUpdateMonitor.java#L136-L140">times out</a> but because I don't have to enter it every single time I unlock it, it's not too much of a hassle so I don't mind having a longer and more secure password.</p>
