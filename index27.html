    <p>Google have published some <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html">statistics</a> about the rate of IPv6 adoption. They have a better view into traffic and adoption rates than most and so their statistics are generally considered to be the most accurate, but I've always found their graph a little puzzling.

    <p><strong>Update 2017-06-29:</strong> I've done an <a href="./setting-up-full-disk-encryption-on-debian-9-stretch.html">updated version</a> of this tutorial with Debian Stretch.
