    <h3><a href="https://xo.tc/how-often-should-you-change-your-password.html">How often should you change your password?</a></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>There was an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/08/frequent-password-changes-are-the-enemy-of-security-ftc-technologist-says/">article</a> recently based on a <a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~reiter/papers/2010/CCS.pdf">2010 study</a> that suggested that frequent password changes actually negatively impact security.</p>
<p>I agree with the article but feel that some of the commentary could be a little more nuanced. The thrust of the article is that forcing regular password changes <a href="https://xo.tc/avids-rule-of-usability.html">irritates users</a> and they turn to patterns like adding a number on the end and just incrementing it. I've seen my share of users who will happily announce to the world that their password is 'August2016' without being asked.</p>
<p>If MySpace forced passwords to expire every 30 days and you found 'March2008' in the recent <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#MySpace">MySpace</a> breach, it wouldn't take a genius to work out what was next.</p>
<p>On the other hand, occasional password changes do have their place. Should MySpace wait until there is public evidence of a breach to force a reset? What about other organisations like <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/06/password-re-user-get-to-get-busy/">Facebook and Netflix</a> who reset passwords of users because they had reused passwords their MySpace password? There are a lot of ifs here;</p>
<ul>
<li>If MySpace had used a secure hash like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">bcrypt</a> then all but the weakest of passwords would be secure and;</li>
<li>If users picked passwords with a significant amount of entropy they wouldn't be cracked even if MySpace just used md5 and;</li>
<li>If users didn't reuse passwords across sites it wouldn't be an issue for other site anyway and;</li>
<li>If ...</li>
</ul>
<p>Our natural response as security professionals is to try to <em>force</em> people to use good password hygiene so we resort to things like password expiry dates and complexity requirements that actually restrict the number of available passwords.</p>
<p>We should look at ways to <em>encourage</em> good password hygiene, sign up forms can offer the option to generate a password<sup id="fnref:generate"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:generate">1</a></sup> and a button to copy it into the clipboard so users can use a password manager. Maybe organisations should include tools like <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> as part of the standard operating environment and make them available on all desktops.</p>
<p>In the future we need to move to things like two factor authentication with a <a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/">hardware</a> <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">device</a> and reduce our reliance on passwords.</p>

<li id="fn:generate">
<p>My preferred method of generating passwords is <code>dd if=/dev/random bs=1 count=18 2&gt;/dev/null | base64</code>. I haven't looked into this at all, but I'm sure there would be a secure way to do the equivalent of that in client side JavaScript.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:generate" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
