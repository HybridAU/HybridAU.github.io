    <p>I was lucky enough to be able to go across to Melbourne for <a href="https://ruxcon.org.au/">Ruxcon</a> in 2015 and it was an absolute blast. I'd recommend it to any budding security professional that wants to meet people in the industry and see some great talks. There is a good mix of activities and talks, I think you could spend your whole time at Ruxcon just doing one or the other.</p>
<p>There was a hardware hacking village where people were breaking out the soldering irons and working on circuit boards, I didn't really get a chance to visit that but it sounded pretty ammazing.</p>
<p>They also had ruxlocks where people where learning how to pick locks and handcuffs. I was really exited to try it out and they had a practice lock. It was a padlock where the base was made of clear plastic so you could see the pins as you moved them with the lock pick. I managed to unlock that fairly quickly (about 3 or 4 minutes which is not too bad for a first try). Then I moved on to a real padlock and after a while I managed to open that as well.</p>

<p>Then I had a go with the handcuffs, that went pretty well. I started with just one cuff on and the other hand free and got out of it surprisingly easily. So then I tried to do it with both wrists and just after I'd locked my self up, the pizza arrived. Not wanting to miss out I ate pizza with handcuffs on then got back to picking my way to freedom.</p>

<p>I also spent a bit of time the capture the flag competition where I feel that I did reasonably well. I got all the easy flags at any rate.</p>
<p>And while all that was going on there were also two streams of talks running as well. I tried to see as many talks as I could but didn't see as many as I'd have liked. One of the stand out talks for me was <a href="https://ruxcon.org.au/speakers/#Vanessa%20Teague">Vanessa Teague's talk</a> on the iVote system. It was a both fascinating and horrifying view into how the New South Wales online voting system was designed.</p>
<p>If you have never been to Ruxcon before but are interested in security I would recommend checking it out, it's well worth the money.</p>
