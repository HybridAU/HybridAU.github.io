    <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> I tried the free version, I like it.</p>
<p>Amongst other things I do in my day job, I administer a WordPress site. We had a security audit and one of the findings was that our site was misconfigured to show a different failure message for a login when the username exists to when it doesn't. This allows for user enumeration which makes brute-forcing easier because you don't waste time trying to brute force accounts which don't exist.</p>
<p>My first thought was that the auditors had made a mistake, we were running very vanilla WordPress on the latest version and I thought surely that's something the WordPress team would have patched if it was an issue with the default install.</p>
<p>It turns out I was wrong, I couldn't find any definitive statement from the WordPress team but it seems they don't think user enumeration is an issue<sup id="fnref:not-an-issue"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:not-an-issue">1</a></sup>. Along with different log in prompts, there are several other places in WordPress that leak usernames such as appending <code>?author=1</code> to the URL of the site.</p>
<p>So I went looking for a way looking for a way to patch that and found <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/">Wordfence</a>.</p>
<p>After installing it I checked the password failure message and that was fixed. Then I started looking through some of the other features and was impressed with the brute force protection, they have sensible defaults and fairly good metrics.</p>
<p>I also saw they had a scanner which checks the integrity of the WordPress core files which is a good idea.</p>
<p>The plugin can also provide two-factor authentication which is a great idea but that's a paid feature.</p>
<p>Over all, I'd say it's a good plugin and I will be installing it on any WordPress sites I'm responsible for in the future.</p>

<p>To be clear, this is not an unreasonable view to hold. It's more of an information disclosure than a real security threat. It really depends on what type of site you are running as to how serious this is.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:not-an-issue" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
