  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>One of the nice things about the ASD's <a href="http://www.asd.gov.au/infosec/mitigationstrategies.htm">Strategies to mitigate Targed Cyber Intrusoions</a> is that they rank them by effectiveness. Saying that their top four would prevent 85% of intrusions.</p>
<p>Their top four are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Application Whitelisting.</li>
<li>Patching Applications.</li>
<li>Patching Operating System Vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Restrict Administrative privileges.</li>
</ol>
<p>Patching is two out of the top four recommendations and has long viewed by many IT Security professionals, <a href="./automatic-updates-for-debian.html">my self included</a> as one of the easiest things to do that gets you the best bang for your buck.</p>
<p>I was at a meeting recently where someone said an exploit had not been used against their network in about 6 months. The implication was that a huge percentage of malware these days is delivered as an .exe in a zip file from an email <a href="./tracking-a-spam-campagn.html">claiming to be a traffic infringement</a> or something similar. Suggesting that patching is no longer the easiest win for IT Security.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely convinced that exploits are no longer being used, I think there are plenty of hacked sites and malvertising campaigns that take advantage of unpatched browsers or out of date applications like flash. But I can see a bit of a shift from using exploits to infect computers to simply sending a trojan or a phishing email and relying on tricking users.</p>
