  <div class="article_text">
    <p>I recently looked through my archives and was surprised to find that I hadn't blogged about this before as it's something I get quite passionate about.</p>
<p>Many companies try to set up proprietary standards in IT in an attempt to control the market. It's a horrible practice and needs to be stopped. Imagine if you bought a HP laptop, and then you wanted to connect a printer to it, and instead of a USB port, you needed to buy a printer with a specific HP-Connection. And that type of connector was different from a Dell connection, or Lenovo, or Toshiba, or Sony, or Acer, or ...</p>
<p>Having one standard type of connection benefits everyone. It makes life easier for the consumers and makes the IT industry as a whole develop faster.</p>
<p>A great example of this is things like Firewire vs USB. Many people would argue that Firewire was a better design but there were several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1394#Intellectual_property_considerations">patent issues</a> as well as some weird copyright issues around the name leading to some companies calling it i.LINK, Lynx, or the generic IEEE 1394. Ultimately Firewire did not take off.</p>
<p>It shocks me that even though the EU passed a law that all phones sold in Europ must have a Micro USB (or later USB-C) charger, Apple blatantly flaunts this issue and continues to sell phones with their own proprietary connector.</p>
<p>I've lost count of the number of times people have asked me if I've got a phone charger. I've got Micro USB and USB-C and that will fit any phone made in the last 8 years, except the iPhone. It's not because I don't like Apple, it's because Apple refuses to support open standards. People wouldn't be as surprised if I didn't have the charger for a Nokia N-Gage, or an Ericsson T28 they would accept that it's an unusual phone and I can't hold every type of charger.</p>
<p>The next iPhone whatever version number that might be, would be no less great a phone if it was to come with USB-C.</p>
<p>Embrace open standard, it makes life easier for everyone.</p>
