    <h3><a href="./google-maps-vs-openstreetmap.html">Google Maps Vs OpenStreetMap</a></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>I've been using <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a><sup id="fnref:using-osm"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:using-osm">1</a></sup> for about two years now. I <a href="https://xo.tc/good-bye-google.html">migrated</a> from Google Maps, mostly for philosophical reasons to do with data collection and licensing.</p>
<p>I think the biggest difference between the two can be summed up as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OpenStreetMap has much better coverage of obscure places</strong> (particularly things like hiking trails) if you are going somewhere off the beaten track where the "roads" are just a gravel path or a mud track then use the OpenStreetMap.</li>
<li><strong>Google Maps has much better search</strong>, if you are trying to find a place (particularly things like a local business) use Google Maps.</li>
</ul>
<p>An excellent example of this is a place I stayed at for a few days on holiday when I was younger called <a href="http://www.forrestairport.com.au/">Forrest Air Port</a>. When I stayed there it had a population of 3.<sup id="fnref:population"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:population">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Google Maps finds it easily with a simple search. All it shows is the air strip and a single road.

<p>OpenStreetMap finds it too, but it's a bit harder to find and it's not the first result. Once you do find it through it's got a lot more detail, it's got all the four wheel drive tracks, the walking tracks, it's even got every single house in the town mapped out (all 6 of them), the airplane hangar, the Australia Post Community Postal Agents (post box) in the correct place.
<img alt="OpenStreetMap - Forrest Air Port" src="./images/forrest-airport-OpenStreetMaps.png"></p>
<p>Another place I've stayed is <a href="http://birdlife.org.au/visit-us/observatories/eyre">Eyre Bird Observatory</a>. Google maps can <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Eyre+Bird+Observatory">find it</a><sup id="fnref:finds"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:finds">3</a></sup>, infact all I typed was "Eyre bi" and it had the correct suggestion. But Google Maps it puts the pin on the nearest town which is about 30 km away<sup id="fnref:30km-away"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:30km-away">4</a></sup> although if you change to "earth" view you can find <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/@-32.2464924,126.3024297,340m/data=!3m1!1e3">the house</a>. While <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1604654071#map=19/-32.24650/126.30147">OpenStreetMap</a> has the marker in the right location and has the four wheel drive track marked out too.</p>
<p>OpenStreetMap coverage in metro areas is pretty good, but I think Google's ease of use and search has the edge.</p>
<p>So if your going hiking somewhere there is no phone coverage and you want to navigate by GPS using offline maps OpenStreetMap is the hands down winner.</p>
<p>If your in the metro area and you want to find the nearest burger joint or get navigation that includes public transport or current traffic conditions Google Maps is for you.</p>

<p>I feel that I should point out that while I try to make most of my posts security related using OpenStreetMap over Google Maps is not about security. It's a philosophical stance on licensing, freedom, and openness. I guess you could look at it from the security view of not giving your persoanl informaiton to a large coporation for more about my views on google see my post <a href="https://xo.tc/good-bye-google.html">Good bye Google</a>&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:using-osm" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:population">
<p>Although there were four of us, so I suppose if you count tourists it had a population of 7.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:population" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:finds">
<p>EDIT: 2016-09-05 some time after I posted this Google Maps was updated with the right location. While this example may no longer be correct, I still find that OpenStreetMap has better coverage of obscure country towns with populations you can count without taking off your shoes.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:finds" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:30km-away">
<p>About 50 km by car which takes about an hour and a half because it's a sand track up an escarpment.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:30km-away" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
