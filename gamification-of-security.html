  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>I've been thinking a lot recently about gamification of security. Giving people scores for how well they do security. Things like getting an "A+" on the <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=xo.tc">SSL Labs</a> or on <a href="https://securityheaders.io/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fxo.tc">securityheaders.io</a> test.</p>
<p>Working through Google or Facebook's "Security Checklists" of things like password length and enabling 2 factor authentication where you get a big green tick and a better score for each one you setup. Or password meters that go up with the <a href="./password-strength.html">strength</a> of your password.<sup id="fnref:strength"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:strength">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I think many people (my self included) will try to get a high score, and by doing so improve their security. One of the slightly creepy books that seems to be popular in silicon valley at the moment is <a href="http://www.booktopia.com.au/hooked-nir-eyal/prod9780241184837.html?source=pla&amp;gclid=CKmCwMnVuMoCFYUGvAodeioCTg">Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</a><sup id="fnref:hooked"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:hooked">2</a></sup> while that book is trying to suck more money out of people playing games like candy crush it does make me think:</p>
<p>What psychological techniques can we use to make people actually <em>want</em> security, rather than feeling like they are having it forced on them.</p>

<p>Sure sometimes those things are just a check box and they don't stop things like password reuse. But as long as they don't restrict which passwords you can use (e.g. must have a special character) if they encourage most user to make a better password then they are worth having.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:strength" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>I heard about it from Aral Barkan's talk talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctVOEeowc9U">Decentralise Everything</a>, it's not related to gamification but it's worth watching.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:hooked" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
